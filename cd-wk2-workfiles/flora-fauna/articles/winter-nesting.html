                <h1>Reigning Cats & Dogs</h1>
            
                <p>From tabby to bulldog, Siamese to Shepherd, the message is the same: <q>Feed me, pet me, play with me.</q> And human beings love it. Cats and dogs are our pets, our friends, our children and sometimes even our gods. <strong>Ancient Egyptians</strong> worshipped cats and went so far as to <em>dedicate</em> a city to them. And dogs are revered as man’s best friend, protectors of our homes and eyes for the blind. Many of them have even had their own TV shows. But what are their counterparts in the wild?</p>
