Title: Fill My World Poem by Shobhana Kumar

FILL MY WORLD

by Shobhana Kumar

Break a ray of sun
To fill up my pot of gold,
They'll be my riches

Pluck a rainbow drop
To fill up my walls and home,
They'll colour my world

Pick a drop of dew,
To fill up my lakes and brooks
They'll quench all my thirst

Be one with Nature
Those riches money can't buy
Yet, they'll fill my world.
