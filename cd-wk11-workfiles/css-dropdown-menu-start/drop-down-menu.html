            <h2>Swing with an anti-slice grip</h2>
    
            <p>If you slice, it’s probably because you’re not closing the clubface fast enough through the hitting zone. To improve your ability to deliver a square clubface (relative to your path), make practice swings with your hands split apart on the grip.</p>

            <p>Hold the club in its normal position with your gloved hand, then slide your lower hand down to where the grip meets the shaft (photo, left). Separating your hands like this makes it easier to square the face through impact and keep the handle pointing at your belly button as the clubhead slings out toward the ball. Make sure to brush the grass aggressively. If you can recreate the feels in the drill on real swings, you’re money.</p>
    
            <h2>Give your backswing a power boost</h2>
    
            <p>As you start the club back, make it a goal to get your hands as far away from your right ear as possible and maintain that width all the way to the top of your backswing. A wider swing arc automatically fuels a faster downswing and eliminates the chopping action that causes pop-up drives and slices.</p>

            <h2>Learn the benefits of consistent lag putting</h2>
    
            <p>Pros rarely 3-putt inside of 40 feet, but do so almost a third of the time from outside 60 feet. Even for the best players in the world, lag putting is a score-breaker. Make it a part of any practice session.</p>

            <h2>One key to consistency</h2>
    
            <p>Maintaining good arm structure throughout your swing is a major consistency key. Without it, you’re toast. It’s common to lose that structure by allowing your elbows to separate post-impact, or “chicken wing” (above). The fix? Wedge an object (a headcover or a softball will do) between your forearms at setup and keep it there as you swing. This will help you maintain the correct relationship between your arms and give proper shape and consistency to your swing</p>

            <h2>Keys to Preparing for Golfing</h2>

            <p>Stay within one shot of the group IN FRONT of you.  If you cannot, and there is a group behind you that is pushing, let them play through as soon as possible.  One of the best locations is often on par 3 holes by allowing them to hit up to the green before your group putts out.  This will keep the pace of play flowing smoothly on the course and increase the enjoyment for everyone including your own group.</p>

            <ul class="golf-keys">
                <li>Hit when you are ready and it is safe. Hit without delay; do not use the honor system.</li>

                <li>When using a riding cart, drop your partner at their ball and then continue to yours (provided that you will not be in danger).</li>

                <li>Place your clubs between the green and the next tee. This alone will save a great deal of time and walking.</li>

                <li>Upon approaching the green, begin studying your putt so that when it is your turn to putt, you will be ready.</li>

                <li>Once you begin putting, continue putting until you have holed out.</li>

                <li>Complete your scorecard on the next tee (not on the back of the green that you have just completed). Long rough, tricky greens, or a bad slice do not cause slow play. These are challenges that give golf its appeal. Slow play is the result of bad habits that waste time and impose slower play on everyone. Many bad habits can be corrected by applying these "keys to ready golf".</li>
