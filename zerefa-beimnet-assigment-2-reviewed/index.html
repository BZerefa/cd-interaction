      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I’m <strong>Beimnet Zerefa</strong>, a merit scholar student at Parsons
        majoring in Integrated Design and exploring cultural art practices. I
        have overseen and co-curated a multimedia exhibition at Shelter Gallery
        and am currently working on building a web archive for Ethiopian art and
        design. I am looking to start an internship and work as a creative at
        the intersection of design and tech upon graduation.
      </p>

      <h2>Creative Practice</h2>
      <p>
        My primary interests revolve around cultural practices, regenerative
        design, archival work, and creating art that is meaningful through its
        process. In my creative practice thus far, I engage with a diverse array
        of craft-based multimedia. This includes, but is not limited to,
        textiles, photography, painting, and graphic design. The formal
        qualities of my work are characterized by vibrant colors and busy
        compositions, often featuring rich cultural motifs. Each piece is made
        with the intention to bridge traditional aesthetics with contemporary
        practices, creating work that is both visually stimulating and
        culturally informed.
      </p>

      <h2>Aesthetic Values</h2>
      <p>
        My aesthetic values are deeply rooted in the significance of cultural
        expression and multimedia design. My projects are intentionally designed
        to be non-abstract, focusing on tangible connections to cultural
        heritage and personal identity. The process through which I create my
        work is non-linear and exploratory. I rely heavily on in-depth research
        and regenerative methods, which guide my artistic practice. Instead of
        traditional sketching, I engage in brainstorming sessions accompanied by
        music, which makes for a more creative workflow. Collaboration and
        conversations with like-minded peers also play an important role in
        shaping my practice, allowing me to draw inspiration and insight from
        external sources.
      </p>

      <h2>Artistic Process</h2>
      <p>
        My creative endeavors are driven by the need to articulate complex
        concepts that are often difficult to convey through words alone. I
        believe that art serves as a medium to both preserve and innovate
        cultural heritage. By expanding Ethiopian artistic practices in my own
        methods, I hope to contribute to a broader understanding of cultural
        narratives and their relevance in contemporary contexts. My research
        interests also have a significant influence on my artistic practice. I
        engage in a "rabbit hole" style of researching, immersing myself in a
        multitude of interconnected subjects. This approach not only fuels my
        curiosity but also informs and enriches my creative process, leading to
        unexpected and innovative outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I am focused on honing my digital and technical skills,
        with a particular interest in learning coding to develop an archival
        website dedicated to Ethiopian art and design. This project aims to
        create a unique platform for showcasing and preserving Ethiopian
        artistic practices. Additionally, I plan to start an internship in a
        creative or tech design field to enhance my professional growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through these endeavors, I aspire to continue evolving as an artist and
        designer, bridging the gap between traditional craftsmanship and
        technical skill. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to expanding the art
        world in Ethiopia so that other young Ethiopian artists may have the
        space and resources to grow their practices.
