        <!-- Although there can be multiple <h1> elements per page, there should be only one per structural semantic unit. The various <h1> elements and the content each introduces should be explicitly separated into different structures via the <article> or <section> element. Use the <article> element if each <h1> opens up a new text composition. Use <section> if the heading and the text it introduces are not a separate composition. Additionally, all <h1>s should be placed at the same level within the HTML hierarchy. Lastly, an <h1> cannot be at a level lower than any other heading within the hierarchy. -->

          <strong>Concept:</strong>
          This project is an exploration of New York through digital
          illustration.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Objective:</strong>
          The goal was to challenge myself by using Adobe Illustrator skills to
          design vector art in a distinct visual style of my own.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong>
          The final illustrations are scenes of the city captured through a
          vibrant and geometric vector art form.
        </p>

          <strong>Concept:</strong>
          Lost and Found explores multiculturalism, recognizing the significance
          of shared experiences among individuals from different cultural
          backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Objective:</strong>
          The mission was to establish a space that celebrates and unites people
          of color from multiple cultural backgrounds residing in New York City;
          challenging the traditionally exclusive gallery experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong>
          The final show is a multimedia exhibition that delves into the themes
          of belonging, comfort, and human connection through visual
          storytelling. Its curation is in the form of photography, painting and
          sound.

          <strong>Concept:</strong>
          This piece is comprised of photographs from my recent trip in
          Ethiopia, all of which are taken in my childhood house.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Objective:</strong>
          I wanted to recall the images of home, reimagining my childhood
          through the language of textile and embroidery.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong>
          The final piece is a photographic transfer print on organza fabric
          adorned with embroidery that extends each image beyond its borders.
