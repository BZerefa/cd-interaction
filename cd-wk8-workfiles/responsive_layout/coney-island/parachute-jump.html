        <h2>Parachute Jump History</h2>

        <p>
          The Parachute Jump is a defunct amusement ride in Coney Island,
          Brooklyn, New York, whose iconic open-frame steel structure remains a
          Brooklyn landmark. 250 feet (76 m) tall and weighing 170 tons (150
          tonnes), it has been called the "Eiffel Tower of Brooklyn".
        </p>

        <p>
          It was originally built for the 1939 New York World's Fair in Flushing
          Meadows–Corona Park, Queens,[4] and moved to its current site, then
          part of the Steeplechase Park amusement park, in 1941. It is the only
          portion of Steeplechase Park still standing today. The ride ceased
          operations in 1964, when the park shut down for good.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ride was based on functional parachutes which were held open by
          metal rings throughout the ascent and descent. Twelve cantilevered
          steel arms sprout from the top of the tower, each of which supported a
          parachute attached to a lift rope and a set of surrounding guide
          cables. Riders were belted into a two-person canvas seat hanging below
          the closed chute, then hoisted to the top, where a release mechanism
          would drop them, the descent slowed only by the parachute. Shock
          absorbers at the bottom, consisting of pole-mounted springs, cushioned
          the landing. Each parachute required three cable operators, keeping
          labor expenses high.
