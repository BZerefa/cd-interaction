      <h1>What Is a Front-End Developer?</h1>

      <p>
        Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
        practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
        Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. (For
        continued reading go to this
        <span class="tutorial"
          >training site<a
            class="more-info"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"
            target="_blank"
            >Mozilla</a
          > </span
        >.) The challenge associated with front end development is that the
        tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change
        constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the
        field is developing.

        The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open
        up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read
        and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use
        a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions
        thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when
        designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up
        correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating
        systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which
        requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
